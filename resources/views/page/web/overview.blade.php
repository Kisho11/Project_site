            <h3>Overview of our school</h3>
            <p>
                Established in 1927, Kn/Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam has a storied tradition of cultivating leaders
                and visionaries who make significant contributions to our district and beyond. Situated in the
                heartland of Sri Lanka, it stands as a prestigious leading mixed school in the Kilinochchi district
                and is the largest school in the Wanni region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kn/Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam was founded by Sir Pon. Ramanathan to fulfill the educational
                needs of the workers' children of the Iranaimadu tank construction. Over the years, the school has
                grown significantly, adding new facilities and expanding its educational offerings. From its early
                beginnings with a single classroom, the school now boasts a wide range of modern facilities,
                including 24 new classrooms, an open-air theatre, and an auditorium, thanks to a renovation
                funded by the Australian government in partnership with UNICEF.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a 1AB grade institution, we offer a comprehensive educational journey from Grade 1 to Grade
                13, accommodating a diverse array of student interests and aspirations. At the GCE Advanced
                Level, we provide specialized streams in Biology, Mathematics, Arts, and Commerce, equipping
                students with the knowledge and skills to excel in their chosen fields. The introduction of
                Advanced Level classes in 2013 for Maths and Science streams has significantly boosted the
                number of students pursuing these subjects, paving the way for many to enter universities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout its history, the school has faced numerous challenges, including the devastating
                impacts of the civil war. Despite these hardships, the school community, supported by principals,
                teachers, parents, and well-wishers, has shown remarkable resilience and determination. The
                school has overcome physical damage and other barriers to continue providing a high-quality
                education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Kn/Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam serves over 2400 students with a dedicated team of 101
                teachers. It is renowned for its excellent academic performance, with students achieving record
                results in national examinations such as the Grade 05 scholarship, GCE O/L, and GCE A/L exams.
                Alongside academic success, the school also excels in extra-curricular activities, providing a wellrounded
                education.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to combining student-teacher resources with social resources to create
                innovative and sensitive citizens who can meet the changing needs of the world. Our prestigious
                institution, which began with the blessing of God, continues to progress steadily toward a bright
                and prosperous future.
