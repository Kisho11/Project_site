            <h3>Great history of our school</h3>
            <p>
                In the Northern Province, Kn/Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam is a prestigious leading mixed school
                in the Kilinochchi district, and it is the largest school in the Vanni region, also known as the
                heartland of Sri Lanka.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our school was founded by Sir Pon. Ramanathan on 29.07.1927 to fulfil the educational needs of
                the workers’ children of the Iranaimadu tank construction. He bought a plot of land near the A9
                road, built one classroom, and started operating as a Tamil medium school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. J.N. Saravanamuththu was the first principal of the school. More land adjoining the school
                was acquired, and necessary buildings, including the new office, main hall, and teachers’
                quarters, were constructed during that period.
            </p>
            <p>
                A little later, a Tamil medium primary school was also started there. In 1955, the area of the school
                was extended, and more buildings were erected. In 1938, J.S.C classes were started, marking a
                turning point in the school's development. In 1963, it was promoted as Maha Vidyalayam.
                Gradually, GCE O/L classes were added in 1964.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1979, more than six classes were separated due to population growth, leading to the
                establishment of Kilinochchi Central College, while this school continued to function as a Kanista
                Vidyalayam. In 1993, Advanced Level Arts and Commerce streams were started.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the school encountered many hardships and losses during the civil war, it overcame these
                challenges with the wholehearted cooperation and committed service of the principals, teachers,
                parents, and well-wishers. Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam was damaged during the conflict, which
                had disastrous effects on the local community and children’s education. Despite this, the school
                community overcame these barriers. The dilapidated buildings and damaged facilities were
                repaired, and school activities resumed with great vigour.
            </p>
            <p>
                In February 2012, the school was renovated by the Australian government and officially opened
                by the Australian High Commissioner, HE Ms. Robyn Mudie. The school was funded by Australia
                and built in partnership with UNICEF. Twenty-four new classrooms, an open-air theatre, and an
                auditorium were rebuilt with this funding. The newly constructed buildings provided a better
                learning environment with larger classrooms and improved facilities. In addition to funding the
                reconstruction, Australia also funded teacher training in ‘child-centered' teaching methodologies,
                proven to help children improve their learning outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The school was upgraded to a 1AB school on 06.05.2013, and Advanced Level classes were
                introduced for Maths and Science streams, paving the way for students to enter universities.
                Remarkably, the number of students following Science and Maths streams tripled. As part of its
                social responsibility agenda, LOLC Micro Credit Limited (LOMC) refurbished the computer
                laboratory of Kilinochchi Maha Vidyalayam and donated twenty used desktop computers to make
                ICT accessible to the students. As phase one of the CSR project, the playground of Kilinochchi
                Maha Vidyalayam was redeveloped, and trees were planted under LOMC’s island-wide tree
                planting programme.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, this school has over 2400 students and 101 teachers and follows the National Curriculum
                Programme of Study. It is the oldest school in Kilinochchi, with a well-deserved reputation for
                delivering a high-quality education programme for over 90 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of the untiring efforts of the old students’ association of 1996, a new entrance was
                erected on a grand scale in 2020. In 2021, a two-storey building consisting of 10 classrooms was
                constructed for primary education from grade 01 to grade 05.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grade 05 scholarship examination, GCE O/L examination, and GCE A/L examination results have
                set records at the national level. Along with academic achievements, extra-curricular activities are
                also noteworthy. The standard of education and co-curricular activities are the indices of the
                school and zone as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though it has inadequate physical, human, and material resources, the best performance
                can be regarded as having performed above the required academic performance and the desired
                standard, which should be acknowledged and appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will combine student-teacher resources with social resources to create innovative and
                sensitive citizens to meet the changing needs of the world. The school, which started with the
                blessing of God, now progresses steadily onward and upward towards the light. We wish our
                prestigious institution a bright and prosperous future.
